# ENIGMA
Program that encrypts input text like an enigma machine. Different rotors, reflectors, and plugs may be specified. To decrypt the text, user must start with the same intial settings that the code was encrypted with.
Project could expand to crack code by running it through different configurations, and narrowing down the possibilities similar to how the Bletchley Park team operated.
